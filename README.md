# Aview-Challenge

Coding Challenge for Aview International

Objective: Create a web application that integrates with a free public API to display content, then translate that content into a chosen language.

Background: At Aview International, we work with content from all over the world. Therefore, it's critical that we can understand and translate content into different languages effectively. In this challenge, you will demonstrate your skills in API integration, frontend development, and your understanding of translation services.

Task: Your task is to create a simple web application. This application should accomplish the following:

API Integration: To fetch and display content, use a public API like The Dog API (https://thedogapi.com/) or the JokeAPI (https://jokeapi.dev/). You should fetch content from these APIs and display it on your application.

Translation: Add a feature that allows the user to translate the fetched content into a different language. You can use any free translation API like LibreTranslate API (https://libretranslate.com/docs).

User Interface: The web application should have a user-friendly interface. The content fetched from the API should be displayed clearly, and the user should be able to easily select a language for translation.

Evaluation Criteria:
Proper functioning of the application - The app should fetch and display content and translate it correctly.

Code quality - Your code should be clean, well-organized, and easy to understand. Proper comments and documentation are also essential.

Error handling - Your application should handle potential errors gracefully.

User Interface Design - The application should be easy to use and visually appealing.
